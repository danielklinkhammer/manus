# Six Fundamental Properties of VUI Design - Smashing Magazine

## 1. Voice-First Design
- Design hands-free and eyes-free user interfaces
- Even when a VUI device has a screen, always design for voice-first interactions
- The screen can complement voice interaction, but users should be able to complete operations with minimum or no look at the screen
- Some tasks become inefficient or impossible to complete by voice alone (e.g., browsing search results)
- Avoid creating actions that rely solely on screen interaction
- Consider experiences where users start with voice and then switch to visual or touch interfaces when necessary

## 2. Natural Conversation
- The interaction shouldn't feel like talking to a robot
- Conversation flow should be user-centric, resembling natural human conversation
- Users shouldn't have to remember specific phrases to get the system to do what they want
- Use everyday language and invite users to say things in the ways they usually do
- If you need to explain commands, it's a clear indication that something is wrong with your design

## 3. Personalization
- Personalization goes beyond just saying "Welcome back, %username%"
- It's about knowing genuine user needs and wants and adapting information to them
- VUI gives designers a unique opportunity to individualize the user's entire interaction
- The system should recognize new and returning users, create user profiles, and store collected information
- The more the system learns about users, the more personalized experience it should offer
- Designers need to decide what kinds of information to collect from users to personalize the experience

## 4. Tone of Voice
- Voice creates an impression of gender, age, education, intelligence, trustworthiness, and other characteristics
- It's vital to give your VUI a personality - create the right brand persona that matches brand values
- A good persona is specific enough to evoke a unique voice and personality

## 5. Context of Use
- Understand where and how the voice-enabled product will be used
- Consider: Will it be used by one person or shared between many people?
- Consider: Will it be used in public or private areas?
- Consider: How noisy is the environment?
- The context of use will impact many product design decisions

## 6. Sense of Trust
- Trust is a foundational principle of good user experience
- User engagement is built on a foundation of trust
- Good interaction with the voice user interface should always lead to the buildup of trust

### Trust-building recommendations:
- Never share private data with anyone
  - Be careful to verbalize sensitive data such as medical data because users might not be alone
- Avoid offensive content
  - Introduce offensive or sensitive changes by age and region/country
- Try to avoid purely promotional content
  - Don't mention products or brand names out of the context because users may perceive it as promotional content
