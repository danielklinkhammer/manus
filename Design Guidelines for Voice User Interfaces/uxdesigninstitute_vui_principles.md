# Voice UX Design Best Practices - UX Design Institute

## Process Steps for Voice UX Design

### Step 1: User Research
- Observe where the voice assistant can help the user
- Understand the interaction between the user and the voice interface at various stages
- Understand both the user persona and the voice persona (friendly, businesslike, funny)

### Step 2: Create a Competitive Analysis
- Find similar cases to what you're designing for
- Create a competitive analysis to understand how competitors design voice interactions

### Step 3: Define Conversation Flows
- Create scripts for conversations between user and voice assistant
- Consider all possible directions the conversation could take
- Start by defining user needs and pain points for different scenarios
- Turn scenarios into different conversation flows
- Conversation flows should start with keywords to begin the interaction (e.g., "Hello", "Hey Google")
- Include sample dialogues and branches that indicate where the dialogue could go
- Keep the interaction conversational
- Create a strong error handling strategy
- Confirm when tasks are completed

### Step 4: User Testing
- Test conversation flows to evaluate success
- Test with one person playing the device and another playing the user
- Especially helpful when someone from the voice UX team plays the device and someone from outside the company plays the user

## Opportunities in Voice UX Design

### Conversation Flow
- Create clear responses and instructions when needed
- Account for all possible user responses, including errors
- Innovative conversation flows are still being created and opportunities for more abound

### Personalization
- Get to know the user and adapt information to their wants and needs
- The more the voice interface learns about users, the more personalized experience it can offer
- Learning what to use to personalize a voice system varies for different systems

### Adaptability
- Voice interfaces should adapt to different users and their changing needs over time
- Example: If a user uses school supplies for 9 months but not in summer, the system should learn when to ask about notebooks and when to let it go
- This is a rich area full of opportunities

## Challenges in Voice UX Design

### Lack of Capabilities
- Without visuals, it's difficult to tell users what the system can do
- Some users stick with minimum functionality while others try many commands but miss key strengths
- Challenge for designers to convey the breadth of system capabilities

### Lack of Trust
- Error prevention is nearly impossible, but error correction should be easy
- Voice interfaces hear things incorrectly and it's frustrating to fix errors
- Users have trouble trusting voice interfaces and limited desire to try new capabilities

### Handling Distractions
- Voice interfaces struggle with handling distractions that occur in real life
- When users get distracted during dictation, it's unclear where to resume
- Designers must decide whether to read everything back (risking annoyance) or only key details (risking omissions)

## Best Practices for Voice UX Design

### 1. Use Natural Language Processing
- Natural language processing (NLP) is vital but has limitations
- NLP struggles with complex or nuanced language
- Make conversational flow straightforward and easy to understand for a more intuitive experience

### 2. Design for Context
- Understanding the context of interaction is key
- Context includes time of day, user location, and previous interactions
- Example: Time of day affects whether to ask about weather or dinner music
- Context determines what makes sense in a conversation

### 3. Design for Accessibility
- Make voice interfaces accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities
- Consider users with accents or dialects
- Include features like speech-to-text and text-to-speech as input methods
- Consider usability for non-native speakers or those with accents
